# EverPwnage

**iOS 8.0-9.3.6 Jailbreak for 32-bit Devices**

## Usage

Download and sideload the IPA from the [latest release](https://github.com/LukeZGD/EverPwnage/releases/latest).

## Supported Devices

- **A5(X) devices:** iPhone 4S; iPad 2, 3, mini 1; iPod touch 5
- **A6(X) devices:** iPhone 5, 5C; iPad 4

## Untether

EverPwnage has an **"Install Untether" toggle**, which controls the installation of EverUntether.

- The toggle is **enabled by default** for a fully untethered jailbreak.
- Users can manually disable the toggle if they prefer to remain semi-untethered.
- **iOS 9.3.5 and 9.3.6 are not untethered**. Semi-untethered only.

EverUntether is a combination of [jsc_untether](https://github.com/staturnzz/jsc_untether) by staturnz (thanks to their work and assistance) and a [forked version](https://github.com/LukeZGD/daibutsu) of daibutsu untether (based on v1.2.3), updated to replace Trident with [oob_entry](https://github.com/staturnzz/oob_entry), and some fixes for iOS 9 support. Compatible with all 32-bit devices on iOS 8.0-9.3.4.

## Switching from Other Jailbreaks

If you are using other iOS 8 jailbreaks like EtasonJB, HomeDepot, or openpwnage, you can switch to EverPwnage. Jailbreaking with EverPwnage and keeping the "Install Untether" toggle enabled will switch your device to EverUntether.

Devices that already have daibutsu untether installed can also switch to EverUntether. Simply install the EverUntether package from my repo.

Do **not** use EverPwnage if your device is already jailbroken with these: Pangu8, Pangu9, TaiG, PPJailbreak, wtfis

These jailbreaks are already untethered and/or incompatible with migration.
