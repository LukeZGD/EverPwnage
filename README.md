# EverPwnage

iOS 8.0-8.4.1 32-bit Jailbreak.

## Usage

Sideload the IPA from the [latest release](https://github.com/LukeZGD/EverPwnage/releases/latest).

## Supported Devices

- iPhone 4S
- iPhone 5
- iPhone 5C
- iPad 2
- iPad 3
- iPad 4
- iPad mini 1
- iPod touch 5

## Untether

The jailbreak offers two modes: semi-untethered or fully untethered, depending on the state of the Install Untether toggle.

Enabling the Install Untether toggle installs daibutsu untether on the device. This is compatible with iOS versions 8.0–8.4.1 for A6(X) devices, and iOS 8.3–8.4.1 for A5(X) devices.

For iOS 9.0.x devices and A5(X) devices running iOS 8.0–8.2, the Install Untether toggle cannot be enabled, limiting these devices to a semi-untethered jailbreak.

## Other Jailbreaks

Users of other iOS 8 jailbreaks, such as EtasonJB, HomeDepot, and openpwnage, can also switch to EverPwnage. By jailbreaking with EverPwnage and enabling the Install Untether toggle, their device will switched to daibutsu untether.

This does not apply to the following iOS 8 jailbreaks: Pangu8, TaiG, PPJailbreak, and wtfis. Do not use EverPwnage if you are on one of these jailbreaks, as they are already untethered and/or not for 32-bit devices in the case of wtfis.

## Building

This project is built using Xcode 10.1 and macOS High Sierra 10.13.6.
