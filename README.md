# EverPwnage

iOS 8.0-8.4.1 32-bit Jailbreak.

## Usage

Sideload the IPA from the [latest release](https://github.com/LukeZGD/EverPwnage/releases/latest).

## Supported Devices

- iPhone 4S
- iPhone 5
- iPhone 5C
- iPad 2
- iPad 3
- iPad 4
- iPad mini 1
- iPod touch 5

## Untether

The jailbreak offers two modes: semi-untethered or fully untethered, depending on the state of the Install Untether toggle.

Enabling the Install Untether toggle installs daibutsu untether on the device. This is compatible with iOS versions 8.0–8.4.1 for A6(X) devices, and iOS 8.3–8.4.1 for A5(X) devices.

For A5(X) devices running iOS 8.0–8.2, the Install Untether toggle cannot be enabled, limiting these devices to a semi-untethered jailbreak.

## Other Jailbreaks

Users of other iOS 8 jailbreaks, including EtasonJB, can also use EverPwnage. By jailbreaking with EverPwnage and enabling the Install Untether toggle, their device will switched to daibutsu untether.

## Troubleshooting

If the app crashes after tapping go, just reopen the app and try again.

If the device reboots after tapping go, the untether has most likely been successfully installed. Wait for Cydia to appear on the home screen.

If Cydia does not appear on the home screen, open Cydia via Safari by navigating to `cydia://`. Add my repo `https://lukezgd.github.io/repo`, install "Jailbreak App Icons Fix" and then reboot your device.

## Building

This project is built using Xcode 10.1 and macOS High Sierra 10.13.6.
